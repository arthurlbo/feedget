### Hi there! 👋

> A feedback widget for the user to share an idea, report issues or any other relevant information.
>
> The objective of this project was to improve my UX and UI skills and also the improvement of tools for mobile development such as React Native, Typescript, React Native Reanimated, among others.
>
> The first version was developed in the [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) Next Level Week #8. After a year I decided to change some things in the project, putting into practice my experience acquired during that time.
