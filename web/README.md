### Hi there! 👋

> A feedback widget for the user to share an idea, report issues or any other relevant information.
>
> The objective of this project was to improve my UX and UI skills and also the improvement of tools for frontend development such as React, Typescript, Tailwind, among others .
>
> The first version was developed in the [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) Next Level Week #8. After a year I decided to change some things in the project, putting into practice my experience acquired during that time.
>
