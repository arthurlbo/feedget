### Hi there! 👋

> A feedback widget for the user to share an idea, report issues or any other relevant information.
> 
> An end-to-end developed application, with the aim of collecting user feedback and sending via email. 
> 
> The feedback capture API was developed in TypeScript, using the Express, Prisma, Nodemailer and Mailtrap libraries, offering a complete and practical solution to collect user feedback and send this feedback by email.
> For the web application we used React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite and some other tools. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface to collect their feedback efficiently.
> Taking advantage of the knowledge in React, ReactNative was used with Typescript for mobile app, using Expo to facilitate the initial settings. 
> 
> The first version was developed in the [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) Next Level Week #8. After a year I decided to change some things in the project, putting into practice my experience acquired during that time, 
reorganizing the code and structure.
